# diabetes_detection
Problem Statement:
To diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset

Solution:
I first imported modules and loaded the dataset.Next,I shared some statistics
about the dataset and I have checked for null values.Then I have made a correlation matrix and represented it on a heat map. I have done a train test split of 60:40 while training the model, I used 3 classification algorithms:1) Logistic regression
                                              2) Decision tree
                                              3) K-nearest neighbour
